## Thoughts
So good they can't ignore you, the thing that most stuck with me, is that, i have to find what value i can give to the world, instead of thinking what value does the world has to offer me.

The world isn't going to give me anything. and instead, i should focus on what i can offer to the world, waiting my true calling is a waste of time i should focus in the art i make.

I'm in my third year of computer science and i was starting to feel anxious about going out there to get a job, to be honest, i don't have anything valuable to offer.

The only things i know how to do well is googling the things i don't know.

I was starting to think that this isn't my thing, and that i should look for something else.
After reading this book, i now know that i was wrong.
I haven't gotten to the edge of my learning journey, i haven't seen what i should really do.

It is hard, painful, i sometimes i hate to thing about it.

But i like to think in my future me, if i keep this path, struggling and suffering.

Some day i will be really good at it

Is not a mistake if you failed on the first try, is a mistake if you fail a second time and you didn't learn from the first one

if I stay with it, then one day I will have been working on it for forty years, and anyone who sticks with something for forty years will be pretty good at it.

## Things i have to apply in my life in order to learn from this book
-   Rule 1, Don't follow your passion
	- The passion mindset is bad advice, i have to focus on the **craftsman mindset**, where i focus relentlessly on what value I'm offering the world.
- Rule 2, Importance of skill
	- Working right trumps finding the right work
	- The foundation of finding love that you love is by acquiring a large store of **Career capital**
	- Invest in **Career capital**, Invest in rare and valuable skills
	- Focus on the craftsman mindset
	- Focus on the **Deliberate practice**, an approach to work where you deliberately stretch your abilities beyond where you're comfortable and then receive ruthless feedback on your performance.
- Rule 3, Invest your career capital with precaution 
	- Gain control over what you do and how you do it is incredibly important
	- If you're not in control of your life, it will eat you up
		- Careful with the two traps
			- It's dangerous to try to gain more control without enough capital to back it up
			- If you have the capital to back up a bid for mor control, people will try to gain control of you. your employer will realize that gaining mor control is good for you and not for them
- Rule 4, The importance of mission
	- In order to encounter a great mission, you need the career capital to back it up
	- To encounter these ideas, therefore, you must first get to that cutting edge, which in turn requires expertise. To try to devise a mission when you’re new to a field and lacking any career capital is a venture bound for failure.
	- Once you identify a general mission, however, you’re still left with the task of launching specific projects that make it succeed. a good strategy for this is to make little bets. 
	- Use the law of remarkability
		- it must literally compel people to remark about it, it has to stand out of the rest, like a purple cow
		- it must be launched in a venue conducive to such remarking, without this conduciveness to chatter, a purple cow, may never be seen
